    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <p>This is my first time building a capstone project so this is going to be very beginner-like that you would want to laugh at.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Education: <ol>
            <li>I have done by higher schooling from a school in my hometown.</li>
            <li>I am currently in the 3rd year of my college in Vit Bhopal University.</li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>Work experience
            
        <li>I have no work experience as I am still a student</li>
    </li>
    <li>Skills
        <li>Now this one stings. I tried many times to learn different programming languages and I did but couldn't go into the deeper level of problem solving in them.
            However, I did learn my DSA and solved a few problems in it but still learning. I am going to learn web dev first though.
        </li>
        
    </li>
    <li>Certificates:
        <li>I have a certificate of 3 stars in hackerrank in C language so I guess that counts</li>
    </li>

    </ul>
